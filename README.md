## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

We will mainly explore two datasets that both show the amount of fish caught (in kg) in the most popular lakes of Switzerland. The datasets show the catch amount per fish species, lake, and year. One dataset contains the amount of fish that professional fishers caught, one shows the amount of fish caught by hobby fishers.
In addition to the amount of fish, the surface size of each lake is given in km2

In terms of data cleaning, since the datasets are taken from OpenSwissData, they are very clean already and can be used rightaway. Some species have missing numbers, but those are mostly the species that are more rare anyways. We will thus focus on the most popular fish species in Switzerland.

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.

## Milestone 2 (18th April, 5pm)

## Milestone 3 (30th May, 5pm)

**80% of the final grade**


## Late policy

- < 24h: 80% of the grade for the milestone
- < 48h: 70% of the grade for the milestone
