## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

We will mainly explore two datasets that both show the amount of fish caught (in kg) in the most popular lakes of Switzerland. The datasets show the catch amount per fish species, lake, and year. One dataset contains the amount of fish that professional fisher caught, one shows the amount of fish caught by hobby fisher.
In addition to the amount of fish, the surface size of each lake is given in km2

In terms of data cleaning, since the datasets are taken from OpenSwissData, they are very clean already and can be used rightaway. Some species have missing numbers, but those are mostly the species that are more rare anyways. We will thus focus on the most popular fish species in Switzerland.

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

We think that awareness about the overfishing and destruction of habitats of certain species needs to be raised.
With our project, we try to show the users in a fun and interactive way how the fish population in Switzerland is evolving, which species are getting endangered, and which species are dominating others. The users should get a feeling of how things change deep down in our country's waters.
Furthermore, users might learn new things about species that they have not known until now, such as which species live in which kinds of lakes.
On our website, the user will find the opportunity of an epic saibling (maybe other species too) death match. In other words, the user can choose two lakes among all the given lakes on an interactive map. The curser on the map could be shown in the form of a fishing rod. Starting at the year 1997, the "game" iterates over all years in chronological order. Each year denotes one round of the death match and attributes a point to the lake in which more saiblings were caught. At the end, the lake with more points wins and gets a crown.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.

The datasets were already used by other websites and magazines, one of which is the magazine "[Petri-Heil](https://www.petri-heil.ch/)" which is very popular among fisher. They wrote an article about fish statistics up until the year 2016, which you can find [here](https://www.petri-heil.ch/index.php?cmspath=de/schweizer-fischerei-in-zahlen--723). In the article, various species' statistics are shown, especially the amount of perch, pike, and cisco caught in 2016 by professionals versus the amount caught by hobby fisher.
